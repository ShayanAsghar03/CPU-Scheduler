# CPU Scheduling Algorithms with Gantt Chart

A Java GUI tool to simulate and visualize CPU scheduling algorithms with Gantt Charts.  
This project helps in understanding how different CPU scheduling techniques work by showing their execution order in a clear graphical timeline.

## 📌 Supported Algorithms
- FCFS (First Come First Serve)
- SJF (Shortest Job First)
- Priority Scheduling
- Round Robin
- Custom Priority Scheduling Dynamic Quantum (PSDQ) Algorithm

## 🛠️ Technologies
- Java
- Swing
- AWT

## 📊 Features
- Interactive GUI-based simulation
- Gantt Chart visualization for each algorithm
- Comparison of waiting time & turnaround time
